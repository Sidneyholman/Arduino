# Arduino
Our hack was to create a phone case that would help consumers in emergency situations send out their location to authorities and loved ones. We designed a phone case with two buttons, one to send location and an assuring message to authorities and loved ones, and another to ask for help and send out location in dire situations. We planned to have an Arduino to have two buttons hooked up with bluetooth to an app that would send out all this information. However, it did not go as planned. Our code was reviewed and hardware configuration was reviewed by multiple mentors who have had experience with Arduino's, however they have determined that there is an underlying mysterious issues that could not be found. We switched to 3 different Arduinos, reconfigured the circuit and components multiple times, attended workshops related to hardware hacking, but still could not find the actual issues.
